Thank you for your purchase. 

We hope this pack helps you to create beautiful scenes quickly and easily.

8 example scenes should be included.  The example scenes feature the terrains in a pre-painted mode,
with our custom grass, lava, and ground textures.  The foliage is from Unity's provided free assets.

We tried our best to make the terrains tilable. 

All terrains are Unity terrain objects, so they are fully editable inside Unity.
